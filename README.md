## Jupyter Notebook

Assignment 2 aims to develop a user-friendly Graphical User Interface (GUI) using Jupyter Notebook's advanced features. 

In addition to buttons, text fields, and controls, this new interface incorporates interactive widgets to replace the previous User Interface (UI) provided by the UI node. 

The Jupyter Notebook GUI provides a more streamlined and visually appealing interface for interacting with software written in ROS (Robot Operating System).

Through this interface, robot parameters are monitored more effectively and intuitively by fetching data from ROS and presenting it graphically. Overall, the transformation creates a seamless, interactive way for ROS users to interact, improving their engagement and comprehension.
